        works in my Eclipse" mentality), updating to use standard practices,
        automated testing, stating explicit dependencies, and general

          <h3> Programming languages </h3>
          <p> I love to learn programming languages. It's just one of my
            hobbies. Roughly speaking, the languages near the beginning of the
            list are the languages I have the most experience with, or have
            just found myself programming recently. Towards the middle are
            languages I have limited experience with, but non-trivial
            experience nonetheless -- they're languages I'd love to expand my
            knowledge of. Then, towards the end are more "fringe" languages
            and the strange assembly languages I have experience with. </p>
