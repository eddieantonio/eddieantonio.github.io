      Developed [Forward](http://code-forward.meteor.com) in under 48 hours
      for the hackathon with a team of myself and three other students. I was
      primarily responsible for coding the front-end, developing templates,
      and attaching the background data processing work to the front-end.
      Based on my designer's mockups, I quickly crafted CSS style sheets

    description:
      A Pal (subset of Pascal) compiler written and targeting JavaScript. It's
      not fully implemented. I wrote this after my compilers class,
      implementing the same language.  This gave me a bit of distraction while
      procrastinating on studying for finals, and I learned about [parsing
      expression grammars](http://pegjs.majda.cz/) while writing it.
